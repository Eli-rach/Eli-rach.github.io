    <h2 id="Summary">A Brief Summary</h2> 
        <p>Italian giardiniera is also called sottaceti ("under <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinegar">vinegar</a>"), a common term for <a href="pickled">pickled</a> foods. It is typically eaten as an antipasto or with salads.</p>
        <p>In the United States, giardiniera is commonly available in traditional or spicy varieties, and the latter is sometimes referred to as "hot mix".</p>
        <p>Giardiniera is a versatile condiment that can be used on a variety of different foods, such as bratwurst, bruschetta, burgers, pasta salad, eggs (omelets), hot dogs, tuna salad, sandwiches, and much more. In the U.S. it is not uncommon to use giardiniera on pasta or, in the Chicago area, pizza.</p>
        <p>In the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Chicago#Food_and_drink">cuisine of Chicago,</a> an oil based giardiniera[5] is used as a condiment, typically as a topping on Italian beef sandwiches, subs, and pizza.
        <p>A milder variety of giardiniera is used for the olive salad in the muffuletta sandwich</p>
    
    <h2 id="History">History</h2>
        <p>As important as it is here, giardiniera wasn't invented in <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago">Chicago.</a> It originated in <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy">Italy,</a> where it means mixed pickles. Giardiniera also is the name for a female gardener, which is helpful insomuch as it alludes to the vegetables in the mix. According to Jim Graziano, owner of J.P. Graziano Grocery Co., an Italian import company that's been in business in the West Loop since 1937, giardiniera is the Italian way of preserving vegetables from the garden. "That's the main thing," says Graziano. "It was strictly to protect the vegetables for the winter."</p>                
        <p>Just about every Italian is familiar with giardiniera, says Domenica Marchetti, author of "Preserving Italy," a book about canning and preserving. "Go into a grocery store in Italy, and you'll find all kinds on the shelves," she says.</p>
        <p>Though impossible to know the exact date, giardiniera undoubtedly appeared in Chicago along with the wave of Italian immigration that came to the city in the late 19th century.</p>
   
   
    <h2 id="Ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
    <p>The Italian version includes bell peppers, celery, carrots, cauliflower and gherkins. The pickled vegetables are marinated in oil, red- or white-wine vinegar, herbs and spices.</p>
    <p>Chicago-style giardiniera is commonly made spicy with sport peppers or <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili_powder">chili flakes,</a> along with a combination of assorted vegetables, including bell peppers, celery, carrots, cauliflower,[9] and sometimes gherkins or olives,[10] all marinated in vegetable oil, olive oil, soybean oil, or any combination of the three. Some commercially prepared versions are labeled "Chicago-style giardiniera".</p>
