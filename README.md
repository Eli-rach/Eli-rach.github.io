Hi! My name is Charlie Nevitt.  I am an inspiring game and web developer. It is my belief that web is the best way to express a product, a person, or even an idea. Now, in regard to myself, I am a big nerd.  I am currently into Dungeons and Dragons, Warhammer 40k, Magic the gathering, plenty of videogames like Smash Bros and Valorant and more. Can't wait to see where this class goes.
